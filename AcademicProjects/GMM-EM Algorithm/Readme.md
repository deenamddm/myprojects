# Expectation Maximization Algorithm for Gaussian Mixture Models

## Description
The aim of this project is to develop an expectation-maximization algorithm for Gaussian mixture models and to detect an optimal number of clusters present in the mice protein expression dataset using the algorithm.

## About the dataset
The dataset has around 1080 observations and 70 features that represent various protein levels that produced a detectable level of signals in a nuclear fraction of cortex.
